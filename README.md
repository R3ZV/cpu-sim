# Scheduling Simulator

This project simulates various real time algorithms and benchmarks their
performance in different scenarios.

Implemented algorithms:

 - [x] First Come, First Served (FCFS)
 - [ ] Shortest Job First (SJF)
 - [ ] Shortest time to Completion First (STCF)
 - [ ] Priority based
 - [ ] Round Robin (RR)

## Metrics:

In order to compare scheduling algorithms we will evaluate them based on the
following metrics:

- [x] Turnaround time (T_completion - T_arrival)
- [ ] Waiting time
- [ ] Response time
